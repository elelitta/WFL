Word Formation Latin \(WFL\) is a language resource for Classical Latin that connects lexical items on the basis of word-formation rules \(WFRs\). The scope of WFL is to assign a WFR to each morphologically-complex lexeme \(i.e. one word morphologically derived from another word\) and to link each complex lexeme to its ancestor. All those lexemes that share a common \(not derived\) ancestor belong tothe same “word formation family”. For instance, the noun_ bellatrix _‘she who wages war’, the verb rebello ‘to revolt, rebel’, and the adjective _bellicosus_ ‘fond of war’ all belong to the word formation family whose ancestor is noun _bellum_ ‘war’. The semi-automatic insertion of lemmas into the WFL database establishes input-output relations for a set of lemmas matching the features that characterise each WFR.

WFL has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 658332-WFL. The project is based at the Centro Interdisciplinare di Ricerche per la Computerizzazione dei Segni dell’Espressione \([CIRCSE](http://centridiricerca.unicatt.it/circse_index.html)\), at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy. The project ran from November 2015 to the end of October 2017, and resulted in the publication of a word-formation based lexicon, which is accessible digitally through this website and in connection to the morphological analyser and lemmatiser for Latin Lemlat.

This documentation collects all information regarding how the WFL lexicon was built, together with instructions on how to navigate its site and how and where to find the database for your own personal research.
