# Which Word Formation Rules?

**Word Formation Rules** \(**WFRs**\) were conceived according to the** Item-and-Arrangement **\(IA\) model, which considers word forms either as simple \(non-derived\) morphemes or as a **sequence of morphemes** \(**base** and **affixes**\) having both form and meaning \(Hockett 1954\). IA was chosen as the theoretical model supporting WFL for two main reasons: first, it emphasises the **semantic** **significance** of affixal elements as they are found in the lexicon; secondly, IA was the model adopted by other derivational lexica like _Word Manager_ \(Domenig and ten Hacken, 1992\), after which WFL was designed.

There are two types of word formation processes in Latin: **derivation** and **compounding**.

Derivation can be further split into:

1\) **Affixation**, where one or more morphemes, called affixes, can be attached to the base of a word. Affixation can be of two types, and can involve \(or not\) a change of part of speech:

* **Prefixation**: where the affix is attached **before** the base.
* **Suffixation**: where the affix is attached **after** the base.

2\) **Conversion**, where the derived word incurs only in a change of part of speech without the addition of any affix.



##### Prefixation

In general, we consider prefixes those morphemes that are often equivalent to a preposition, which are attached to the beginning of a word, e.g. ad, ab, ex, prae etc. as indicated by Oxford Latin Dictionary.

Moreover, we have included among prefixes all those numeral affixes that are considered prefixes by the Oxford Latin Dictionary. These are bi-, tri-, quadri-.

The following is a list of prefixes that can be found in WFL:

* a\(b\)-
* ad-
* am\(b\)\(i\)-
* ante-
* archi-
* bi-
* circum-
* con-
* contra-
* de-
* dis-
* e\(x\)-
* ec-
* extra-
* in \(entering\)-
* inter-
* intro-
* multi-
* ne-
* ob-
* per-
* post-
* prae-
* praeter-
* pro-
* quadri-
* re-
* retro-
* se-/sed-/so-
* semi-
* sub-
* subter-
* super-
* tra\(ns\)-
* tri-

##### Suffixation

A suffix is an affix that is placed after the stem of a word, to form another word. 

A list of suffixes that can be found in WFL:

* \(at\)im
* \(i\)cul
* \(i/a\)n
* \(i/e\)ll
* \(t\)io\(n\)
* \(t\)iu
* \(t\)or
* \(t\)ric
* \(t\)ur
* ac
* ace
* al
* an
* ar
* at
* atil
* bil
* bund
* cell/cill
* cr
* cul
* e
* edo/edin
* el
* et
* far
* fex
* go/gin
* i
* ic
* ici
* id
* il
* iss
* ist
* it
* iti
* itud/itudin
* men/min
* ment
* n
* ol
* or
* os
* ri
* sc
* str
* tas/tat
* tori
* tr
* udo/udin
* ul
* uncul
* ur

##### Conversion

We have included change of inflection class, or gender, such as masculine to feminine, or 3rd declension to 1st declension, among N-to-N conversions.

examples: aera N1 &lt; aes N3:n

##### Compounding

##### 

##### Prefixation + Conversion

##### Parasynthesis or double affixation
