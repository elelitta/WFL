Word Formation Rules \(WFRs\) were conceived according to the Item-and-Arrangement \(IA\) model, which considers word forms either as simple \(non-derived\) morphemes or as a sequence of morphemes \(base and affixes\) having both form and meaning \(Hockett 1954\). IA was chosen as the theoretical model supporting WFL for two main reasons: first, it emphasises the semantic significance of affixal elements as they are found in the lexicon; secondly, IA was the model adopted by other derivational lexica likeWord Manager \(Domenig and ten Hacken, 1992\), after which WFL was designed.
