Word Formation Rules \(WFRs\) were conceived according to the Item-and-Arrangement \(IA\) model, which considers word forms either as simple \(non-derived\) morphemes or as a sequence of morphemes \(base and affixes\) having both form and meaning \(Hockett 1954\). IA was chosen as the theoretical model supporting WFL for two main reasons: first, it emphasises the semantic significance of affixal elements as they are found in the lexicon; secondly, IA was the model adopted by other derivational lexica like Word Manager \(Domenig and ten Hacken, 1992\), after which WFL was designed.

##### Prefixation

In general, we consider prefixes those prepositions that are attached to the beginning of a word, e.g. ad, ab, ex, prae etc. 

Moreover, we have included among prefixes all those numeral affixes that are considered prefixes by the Oxford Latin Dictionary. These are bi-, tri-, quadri-.

The following is a list of prefixes that can be found in WFL:

* a\(b\)
* ad
* am\(b\)\(i\)
* ante
* archi
* bi
* circum
* con
* contra
* de
* dis
* e\(x\)
* ec
* extra
* in \(entering\)
* inter
* intro
* multi
* ne
* ob
* per
* post
* prae
* praeter
* pro
* quadri
* re
* retro
* se/sed/so
* semi
* sub
* subter
* super
* tra\(ns\)
* tri

##### Suffixation

##### Conversion

We have included change of inflection class, or gender, such as masculine to feminine, or 3rd declension to 1st declension, among N-to-N conversions.

examples: aera N1 &lt; aes N3:n



##### Compounding

##### 



##### Prefixation + Conversion



##### Parasynthesis or double affixation
